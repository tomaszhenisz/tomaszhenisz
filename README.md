### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Tomasz
#### I am an engineer

I have 8 years of experience in developing 4G solutions,
but my side projects gravitate towards anything involving programming and electronics.
I'm especially keen on creating things related to music, such as guitar effects, both analogue and digital, amplifiers and others.
More to be documented soon.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: my own projects for ARM microcontrollers 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: FreeRTOS 
- ðŸ¦¾ Next objective to explore: maybe some QT
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: thenisz@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: besides engineering I play various musical instruments, such as guitar, bass, drums, Hammond organ and Irish low whistle.
